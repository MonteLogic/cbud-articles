## Accountability

Make sure the employees on your payroll know they are being watched and are expected to provide good quality work. By this same token, keep yourself accountable to them by showing that you're going to go the extra mile for them and are dedicated to make the company work.


## Run with good margins 

In your career you will be low-balled offers which your contract provider will make seem as if it's a great deal. Do the Math carefully to see if the Math works in your favor.

### Never be afraid to say no

It's your time, your money and your bottom line. Your fleet or just one truck can do so many tasks and make ends meet in so many projects, if it doesn't make sense say no. 

Don't be the trucking contractor on the yard who is doing all of the contract none of the other companies want to do. 


### Save for a rainy day

Trucking is a high risk business. This high risk shows itself in accidents, Workman's comp and other costly issues. If you don't have the money saved up, then you will often find yourself fielding vehicles of the lowest quality as that what is in your budget. 
This can lead to you not getting loads in on time, as well as having a hard time finding employees who want to drive low quality vehicles.



### Shiny things aren't good for your bottom line

You shouldn't be buying cars or other things for your hobbies until you get your savings up.

### Good help is hard to find, so make their lives easier.

A non-studios employee can put in studios work if things are streamlined, here's where CBud comes in.
